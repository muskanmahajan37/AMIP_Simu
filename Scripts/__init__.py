The Python repository "AMIP" contains the scripts, data, 
figures, and text for 6 AMIP experiments (CSIC,CSST,AMS,
AMIP,AMQ,AMQS) conducted using SC-WACCM4. We are interested
in the relative roles of surface forcings, including sea ice,
Siberian snow cover, sea surface temperatures, and the QBO 
on the large-scale atmospheric response over the satellite era.
